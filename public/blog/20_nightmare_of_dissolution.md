They felt themselves drifting apart,

like icebergs in the ocean.

I wish I could do something to fix it 

but there is nothing I can do to help you.

Or me.

I wish to be in a promo-infected relationship

Where I would never stop talking about her

Struck by a love fever

Tonight let's praise the survivors of the “mutual breakup”

Where it comes from a mile away,

Unsurprising,

Unwanted nonetheless.

I wish to be in a casually obsessed relationship

Where she wants to spend every waking moment with me

And I do with her

And she goes through her phone to figure out where I am.

And I am right there with her

Tonight let's praise the recovery of a “first love breakup”

The toughest to overcome

It teaches us that the world is bigger than we thought

Things can't stay the same as they used to be.

I wish to be in a Tameless relationship

Wild and free

No rules, no restrictions.

A life of no requirements

Tonight let's praise the rebounded of the “blind side breakup”

The hardest to go through

Because just as everything seems to be going great

It all falls apart

Pray for us because the horrors of loneliness and trauma

Far outweigh the life we could be living with them.

Tonight let us praise our survivors and recovered

Praise the ones who have drifted away as slowly as the glaciers move

Or those who flew apart in a fiery ball of hot gas and profanities.

Pray for us

…Because even tomorrow will be lonesome
