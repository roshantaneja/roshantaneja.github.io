description: "Writing about myself in 10 sentences"

My initials are RST,  which are in perfect, consecutive, alphabetical order.

I tend to make myself laugh a lot, which brings my parents to the border.

My friends find me quite tall,

But with them, I don’t talk at all.

I perform concerts in the shower,

Which goes well over an hour…

But I could never perform with a recorder.

I can’t play a single sport with rackets or a ball

Sports with just my body give me power

With no ball or rackets, I would never be a hoarder.
