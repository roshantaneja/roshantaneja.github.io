Shelter in Place! Shelter in Place!

Life feels like a fever dream

Forever stuck in this lonely space.

---

Hospitals had little time to brace

As infections began to stream

Shelter in Place! Shelter in Place!

---

Toiletries disappearing at a frightening pace

The economy teetering on a balance beam

Forever stuck in this lonely space.

---

I miss my friends, I wish I could touch base

They are much closer than they seem

Shelter in Place! Shelter in Place!

---

Social connections disappearing without a trace

Eternal isolation is a recurring theme

Forever stuck in this lonely space.

---

I'm fed up with this obscure rat race

And so I scream,

Shelter in Place! Shelter in Place!

Forever stuck in this lonely space.
