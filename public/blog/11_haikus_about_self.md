description: 4 haikus that describe who I am
---
Seen too many screens

Perhaps a little too much

I should take a walk

I think that sometimes

I get way too excited

And then the fun ends

---

Fictional people

Much better than real-life dudes

I need to touch grass

Haikus are quite hard

Sometimes they donâ€™t make much sense
