America you lost everything and now you have nothing.

America $30 Trillion in national debt, 2022.

I can't stand my own neighborhood.

America when will you end the war of the Americans?

Go \____ yourself with your AR-15s.

I haven't had my caffeine yet don't bother me.

I can't go to school today I lost my bulletproof vest.

America when will you let us love who we want to?

When will you look at the 38 million people under the poverty line?

When will you fix our crumbling infrastructure?

When will you impeach your corrupt political figures?

I'm sick of your incredible hypocrisy.

When can I wake up one day without fearing it being my last?



America we will never be perfect for each other.

Our alarmist, catastrophic predictions of irreversible climate change

do not affect your actions

You make me want to vomit.

There must be some way to get you to change

America I refuse to give up my rights.

America stop resisting you're under arrest.

America I was a socialist from the moment I saw Bernie I'm not sorry.

America I'm putting my immigrant shoulder to the wheel
