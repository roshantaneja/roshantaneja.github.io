# It’s all about impact.
This January, I’ll be diving into one of the most ambitious projects I’ve ever worked on—finding the optimal locations for water reservoirs in the Losimingori District of Tanzania, home to over 40,000 Maasai people. For years, these communities have walked hours just to fetch water, even though rainfall is abundant for half the year. My goal? Use cutting-edge tools like ArcGIS Pro to bring sustainable solutions closer to home.

Here’s how I’m approaching this challenge.

## The Bigger Picture

Losimingori is a vast, dry region in the Monduli District, about an hour from Arusha. While organizations like Maji Wells and Vijana Assembly have already deployed over 100 rainwater harvesting units, the need for large-scale, centralized reservoirs deep inland remains unmet.

The problem is clear: Where do we place these reservoirs to benefit the most people, given the scattered nature of the Maasai’s settlements and existing water sources?

That’s where this project comes in.

# The Plan

1. Between Now and January 7th

I’ll download and familiarize myself with ArcGIS Pro, focusing on tools for inundation analysis. With guidance from my mentor, Professor Sisi Wang, I’ll simulate one specific reservoir location using satellite image analysis.

2. During the Winter Institute (Jan 7th–17th)
  * Learn and Apply: Master every relevant ArcGIS Pro tool.
  * Analyze Locations: Create a prioritized list of potential sites for reservoirs.
  * Collaborate Locally: Cross-reference my findings with local Maasai leaders to ensure cultural and logistical alignment.

3. After the Institute
  * Head to Tanzania next summer.
  * Work directly with local leaders to build a reservoir and filtration unit in a high-need area.

# Why This Matters

This isn’t just about data or tech—it’s about saving time, improving livelihoods, and fostering dignity. Each reservoir we build eliminates hours of walking for women and children. It’s time they can spend going to school, earning an income, or simply living without exhaustion.

# My Takeaway

As I gear up for this project, I’m reminded of why I started this journey in the first place: to bring technology and empathy together for real-world change. This proposal is just the beginning of a plan that could redefine how we address water scarcity in rural communities like Losimingori.

To everyone tackling their own big projects—whether they involve ArcGIS or something entirely different—here’s my advice: stay curious, stay human, and don’t forget why you started.

January can’t come soon enough. Let’s make it count.
