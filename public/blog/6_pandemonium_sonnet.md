I’m spending my days in isolation,

I might have just been Tom Turna.

Struggling to get an education,

But luckily I got the Moderna.

---

Grocery shoppers in a big ol’ rush,

Toiletries like toilet paper are gone,

I can’t even find myself one toothbrush,

Feels like the world has totally withdrawn.

---

Been stuck in a chair, staring at a screen.

Mindlessly watching hours of Netflix,

Joining Zoom meetings, I simply go green.

Been months since I heard the word “Athletics.”

---

The world was on the brink of an ending

My thoughts on this are surely still pending.
