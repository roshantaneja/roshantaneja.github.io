## **It’s December, and I’m still going.**

Over the past couple of months, I’ve spent more time with Google Docs, Common App, and my to-do lists than with my family. From writing personal stories about my childhood obsession with maps to crafting essays on custom trophy-making (yes, that *Dumpster Fire Award* made an appearance), the college application process has been both a sprint and a marathon. And yet, I’m not done—almost, but not quite. I still have a plethora of essays to get through before the year's end.

It’s a packed schedule in an ever-shrinking amount of time. *But*, I’ve made a decision that feels oddly freeing:

## I Won’t Be Checking *Any* Decisions Until **March**

I know. It sounds strange. Why would someone voluntarily postpone checking college decisions when the *refresh button* exists? But hear me out:

The college application process has been so consuming—constant essays, edits, and interviews—that I want to give myself a mental break. Whether it’s an early or regular decision, opening those portals right away won’t change the outcome. It can wait.

January is symbolic for me. A fresh start, a new year, and the *right* time to face whatever lies ahead with calmness and perspective. My last application is due mid-january, and after that, I'll be taking some time to myself to enjoy a month of my senior year before diving back into the college-craze.

### Why I’m Doing This
1. **Space to Reset:** College decisions shouldn’t dictate my mood during the holidays. I want to enjoy December-March as it is—without refreshing portals or analyzing outcomes.
2. **Perspective:** I worked hard on my applications. I wrote honestly, poured in my experiences, and put my best self forward. Whether it’s a yes, no, or maybe, I can’t control what happens next.
3. **Priorities:** There are still essays to write. I need to focus on finishing strong without distractions.

## The Road Ahead

Once the final submit button is clicked on January 15th, I’ll step away and take a deep breath. Until then, I’ll be finishing my *"Why Major"* essays, polishing the final applications, and figuring out where to throw a wildcard submission.

For anyone in the same boat—whether you’re waiting on decisions or just starting your apps—I hope this post reminds you to give yourself grace. You’ve done *enough*.

January will come soon enough. And when it does, I’ll be ready—no matter what.

**Until then, one essay at a time.**
