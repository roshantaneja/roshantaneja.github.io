High School is over, life has begun.

Good for us, we’ve finished it,

Here's a list of memories for you;

I enjoyed writing this, I’ll admit.

  

Remember when we watched that _Friends_ re-run?

In the basement, it was lit.

Remember who passed out first; it was you.

We slept early, for our sleep schedule was unfit.

  

Or that time when we went for that 9-mile run?

Around the whole of the City, you did commit,

Initially what pain you felt was few,

When the soreness came, you showed grit.

  

What about running in the morning to watch the rising sun?

The freezing air penetrated every jacket slit.

It would make you stronger, you knew.

But the cold would always make me lose my wit.

  

Think about all the things you have done.

All the happiness that life can emit.

If there is anything you need to undo,

Too bad, a letter to the future is a one-way transmit.
