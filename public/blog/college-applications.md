I am currently working on my early college applications, which are due in less than 2 weeks (eek!) I am applying to 6 schools, and I am feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. I have been working on my essays and applications for months, and it's hard to believe that the deadline is almost here. I am looking forward to the next chapter of my life, but I am also sad to leave high school behind. It's a bittersweet time, but I am grateful for all the opportunities that lie ahead. Wish me luck!

On other notes, school seems to be going well. I am enjoying my classes and extracurricular activities (particularly stained glass), and I am trying to make the most of my senior year. I am also looking forward to the holidays and spending time with my family and friends. Life is busy, but I am trying to stay present and enjoy the moment.

That's all for now. I will keep you updated on my college application process and other adventures. Thanks for reading!
