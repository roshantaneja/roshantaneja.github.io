frustration lives within me,

twisting and writhing, 

begging to strike back 

at those who have wronged me. Those who 

have mocked me. For nothing makes me angrier 

…more frustrated 

than a person who steps 

on the hands of the innocent.

and reaches up

towards the stars,

looking down at all the blood on the floor,

and smiles

-

For everybody takes,

and hardly gives.

-

This feeling of anger is unending.

It makes me uneasy, but I tell myself

Its inhibiting, infuriating,

That human nature could be so cruel

So cold

-

Evil.

-

I wish to rid the world of these anomalies, abusers

And i know it will never be possible

Yet still, I shall persist.
