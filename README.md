# Wow what a cool website!

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/roshantaneja/roshantaneja.github.io/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml/badge.svg?event=page_build)](https://github.com/roshantaneja/roshantaneja.github.io/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml)

this is my personal website, currently working on adding support for google analytics.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
